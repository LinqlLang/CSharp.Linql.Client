Reading about core-js and the horrors right before trying to open source something.  Feelings about that. 

Not having the time to actually engage in things like this blog.  Too focused on engineering.  Not necessarily good for the career/exposure 

Struggles of Job search, inadequacies. 

Naming conventions, and how the fragmentation/arguments make no sense.  It is impracticle.  
having arguments with junior engineers.  Who is right? Who is wrong?
The interesting problem: having to wrap internal methods in order to create a standard.  
Is a dialect a better approach?  Why/Why not? 

Issue with LinqlObjects not being copied.  Not idempotent

Tests can just be drop in somehow.  The way it works in linql.client is pretty slick.  Could have some structure around it. 

Need to test all the data types

Is it worht it?  Is this just a curiosity?  Will people actually use it?  Does it matter?
The typescript generator?  having already done it.

May not actually be idempotent

Need to interface out Context and Search in the typescript version

Batch needs to infer its types.  Take a look at flow example:

angular version might want to have observable methods as well
