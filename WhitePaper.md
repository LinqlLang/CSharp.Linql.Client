# Linql: A Next-Generation, Language-Native Graph Api Language
##### Kris Sodroski (2023)  

## Introduction 

Since the inception of the internet, computer to computer communications have become the cornerstone of human progress.  Up until the 1990s, network communications were complex and almost exclusively limited to advanced users, organziations, and governments.  

The introduction of interactive websites, programmed in `javascript` and communicating over `HTTP`,  ushered in the `cyber revolution` by hiding complex communication protocols behind graphical user interfaces (guis) connected to web services (api).  While this `web application` architecture has inanarguably been foundational to mankind, its implementation has created significant communication fragmentation, even when no gui is involved. 

Over the years, there have been many attempts at standardizing communication protocols each with their own advantages and disadvantages.  This paper will explore many of these protocols and propose an alternative protocol, `Linql`, that aims to provide significant advantages over existing methods.
